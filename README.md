D100 DUNGEON - A SOLO EXPERIENCE
A pencil and paper game by Martin Knight ©2017 (V.2.1)
```
The game is played using this book, a pencil, and some dice; a six sided dice (1d6) and two ten
sided dice (2d10) and it would be an advantage if one of the d10’s is a percentile dice with numbers
ranging from 00-90. You will need to create an Adventurer and after some dungeon training each of
your games will start by rolling on a Quest Table, the quest sets the goal for winning the current
game and as your adventurer completes quest they will grow in strength and may gain notoriety and
even become a Legend known through out the lands.

## CREATING A CHARACTER

**CHARACTERISTICS** - There are 3 characteristics used
in the game, STRENGTH (STR), DEXTERITY (DEX)
and INTELLIGENCE (INT). When a player creates a
character for the first time they assign any one
characteristic with 50 primary points, another with 40
points, and the remaining characteristic with 30 primary
points, how these are assigned is entirely up to the
individual, for instance a player could apply 50 points to
STR and 40 to DEX and 30 to INT or 50 to DEX, 40 to
INT and 30 to STR.

**SKILL BONUS -** Each character begins the game with 2
skill bonuses to represent some experience gained in the
world before becoming adventurers. Choose 2 skills from
the skills section of the character sheet and write +5 in
each. Note that all characters have all of the skills listed
on the character sheet, but some will grant them a bonus
to tests.

**REPUTATION** - Now add 1 point of REP (reputation) to the character sheet. Some quests reward
Reputation when they are successfully completed, while others reduce reputation should they be
failed. Reputation can never be raised above 10 or be lowered to below 1.

**EQUIPMENT** - Characters begin the game with some basic equipment, that they have managed to
scraped together. Roll once on Table W and three times on Table A for starting equipment, if you
happen to roll a second piece of armour that is assigned to a location you’ve already equipped
armour in you may either keep the new armour rolled (discard the old piece of armour) or roll
again. Record all details from the table to the correct location on the front of the character sheet,
each dot of an items condition shades in one pip of its repair track. Add 20 Oil, 10 food and 15
Picks to the Supplies area of the adventure sheet, and 3 Lesser Healing Potions (Restore 4 lost HP)
to characters Belt Slots.

**FINISHING** - Add 20 Health Points (HP), 3 FATE and 3 LIVES to the Character Sheet.


## ABILITIES

When a characteristic has reached 50 points it gives the character an ability. Until the ability is
unlocked the character is unable to use it and should the characteristic drop below 50 at any time
during an adventure the ability is locked and can not be used.

**MIGHTY BLOW** – During combat when a natural (an unmodified result) 6 is rolled on the
damage dice the dice is rolled again and the two results are added together for a final result, if
another natural 6 is rolled on the second dice you roll again and so on.

**PERFECT AIM** – During a combat round when rolling for HIT LOCATION you may re roll the
dice once and choose either your first or second result.

**SPELL CASTER** – Until the SPELL CASTER ABILITY is unlocked characters can only use
magic through the use of scrolls. Once unlocked the characters spell book becomes active and the
character may use any spells they have collected. Even before the spell caster ability is unlocked,
characters may still add spells to their spell books, they simply can't use them yet.

The spells that are available to a character is based on their current **INT** value, for instance a
character with an Int of 55 can use all spells listed in spell book within the **INT level** range of 50+
(the first 5), while a character with a Int of 67 can add use all of the spells they have in their spell
book including and up to the 60+ **INT level** (see character sheet). If a character loses Int in such a
way that a spell falls outside this parameter then the spell is not lost, but simply cannot be used
again until the characters Int value is raised high enough to include the spell again.

_Example: A character with Int 67 has filled his spell book with 6 spells, but suffers a curse and
loses 12 INT, his Int is now 55, the sixth spell in his book is no longer available to him and cannot
be used. Later the character slips on a Ring of Wisdom (Int+10) making his Int now 65, the sixth
spell is now available again._

Spells are added to the book as they are acquired, should a player no longer want a spell or wish to
replace a spell it is removed from the book, spells can never swap position in their spell book and
are added at the first available space in the spell book.

To use a spell the character must spend the cost (HP) and perform a spell test below.

**CAST SPELL** – Test: INT (+/- Spell Bonus) [S:Cast] [F: Roll on TABLE C - CURSES] _(Magic)_

## SKILLS

Characters have access to all the skills listed on their character sheet, as they gain experience the
skill gains levels in multiple of +5 up to a maximum of +20. Unless a skill has a bonus it does not
add to the characteristic but the character can still earn experience (see Experience Tracks). When a
test is called for the rules will detail which skills can be used, the player uses all of the skills listed
and can apply all of the benefits those skills provide to the test.


## SKILL TESTS

```
At times in the game a character will need to make a test to perform a
task or achieve goals. The game mechanics will make reference to
skills as “Test: Str -5” or “Test: Int +10” in either case the player
temporarily applies the modifier to their characteristic and rolls the
d100, the result is compared to the Characteristic and if it happens to
be equal to or below the characters current value the task has been
accomplished, if it is higher then the task has failed. Each task will list
the effects for a success and failure as “[S: +5 gp] [F: -1 hp]” in this
case if the character succeeds they receive 5 Gold Pieces (GP) or if
they failed they lose 1 Heath Point (HP).
```
Some results of a test give the player a choice, for instance a “[S: +5 gp/Table I]” result offers a
choice and the player can have either the 5gp or roll on Table I but not both, the slash symbol “/”
always offers a choice, while a result of “[F: -5 hp, -1 Str]” offers no choice and the player is forced
to suffer both consequences. The comma “,” never offers a choice.

_Example: Harry has found a trapped chest and will attempt to pick its lock. Harry has a Dex of 65
and the skills Locks (+5) and Traps (+10)._

**TRAPPED CHEST** – Test: Dex -10 [S:+30 gp/ roll x1 Table TA] [F:-10 hp] _(Locks, Traps)_

```
To open the chest Dexterity is tested and is reduced by 10 points (Dex -10),
Harry has bonuses in both of the skills listed and with a Dex of 65 he deducts
the 10 and adds +5 for his Locks skill and +10 for his Traps skill to give a
Dexterity value of 70 for this test (65–10, +5, +10 = 70). Harry rolls the
d100 and scores 68, just enough, the chest opens and he avoids the trap.
Harry looks at the result for a success [S:+30 gp/ roll x1 Table TA] and
chooses to roll once on Table TA – TREASURE A.
```
## EXPERIENCE TRACKS

The Characteristics and skills have Experience tracks that track a characters experience through the
game, as they perform tasks and accomplish objectives their knowledge and skill in the task may
improve. When a natural roll (unmodified dice roll) is made during a test, including combat tests
that is equal to or less than 10 the player may shade in any single pip on the characteristic
experience track that was involved during the test or any 2 pips on any of the experience tracks of
any skills involved during the test.

_Example: Judith is attempting to avoid a PENDULUM TRAP, she rolls an 8 on her dice. She can
either shade in one pip on her Dex experience track or two pips on any of the skills shown for the
test. She decides to shade in 1 pip on her Trap Skill and 1 Pip on her Lucky Skill._

**_PENDULUM TRAP_** _– Test: Dex -10 [S: Avoid Trap] [F:-4 hp] (Traps,Aware,Lucky)_


Once the Experience track has been completely shaded, add +5 to the characteristic or skill (where
applicable), then erase all of the shading on the track and begin again working towards the next
experience improvement. Once a skill reached +20 or Characteristic has reached 80 they can no
longer be increased and have reached their maximum.

## OTHER CHARACTERISTICS

Other characteristics are defined by the items a character
has currently equipped and may provide a bonus to skills
or characteristics

**DEFENCE (DEF)** - is totalled and deducts from an
attackers damage result.

**DAMAGE (DMG)** - is totalled and added to your
damage dice roll after making a successful attack.

**HEALTH POINTS (HP) BONUS –** When a character
is created they begin with 20 Health Points as their
primary characteristic. Some items collected give the
player a bonus to their HP.

**STR, DEX, INT BONUS** - Added to the characteristic
and the total is applied to the applicable adjusted section
of the character sheet.

**FATE POINTS** - Fate points are rare blessings that the gods have offered a character because they
have fallen into their favour. They can be spent to re-roll any dice of a roll they have just made
(damage dice (d6), the percentile dice (00), the tens dice (1-9), or combination of any dice used for
the roll). If the player is unhappy with the new result they can spend again and again fate points in
order to re-roll any of the dice.

**LIVES (L)** - Like a cat has nine lives and can cheat death on several occasion, our characters are
blessed with the same luck and have a number of lives which can be used each time they would lose
enough HP to be killed. If a characters HP is reduced to zero or less the player may use one of their
lives to cheat death and instead restore their HP to their maximum. Sadly when a character has no
lives remaining and lose their last HP they have died and it is time to start a new character.

## EQUIPPING ITEMS

As items are acquired the player has the option to either backpack the item (record on the reverse of
the Character Sheet) or Equip. When an item is equipped it must be recorded in the correct slot on
the character sheet and only one item per slot is allowed. Weapons either need 1 hand () or 2
hands () to wield, when equipping one handed items the player can record one weapon in the
characters main weapon slot and one in the off weapon slot. Two handed weapons always use both
slots and thus prevent the use of a shield (which is always equipped to the off weapon slot) and two
handed weapons only use one repair track (the main weapon track).


## BELT CHECKS

At times the rules may instruct you to make a “Belt Check”, roll 1d10 and any item equipped in the
slot that matches the result rolled is destroyed (remove from character sheet).

## ITEM REPAIR

When items are equipped there is a risk they may get damaged. The character sheet provides each
item with a repair track, and as damage is dealt to the items an equal number of pips must be
shaded. When the track is full the item is beyond repair and is destroyed (removed from Character
Sheet). If an item is unequipped that has been damaged it must be recorded in the backpack (reverse
side of the Character Sheet) with the damage it has sustained and you must adjust the new item
repair track accordingly.

## COMBAT

When a Monster appears it is added to the Combat Track and providing the monster is defeated will
remain on the track, the next monster encountered is added directly below the last defeated monster,
thus creating a list of defeated monsters, if a monster or character escapes an encounter, the monster
is removed from the track immediately (only defeated monsters remain on the track). The track
offers characters rewards as monsters are defeated and when such a reward follows the details
you’ve added of a defeated monster the character gains that reward. You will notice that the
progress of the track is slow to start and speeds up as more monster are defeated. The combat track
continues over into a new quest and when full you begin another.

When combat is imminent follow the steps below. The character attacks first, followed by the
monster, however all attacks happen simultaneously and so even if the character kills the monster is
will still have its attack roll.

1. Roll on the monster reaction chart to determine its action in the forthcoming round, then continue to step 2.
2. The character rolls a d100 to attack the monster and must score equal to or below his Str or Dex depending on
    the weapon being used – Hand Weapons (H) uses STR, Ranged Weapons (R) uses DEX to hit the monster. If
    the character has two weapons equipped either may be used, but not both. If the result scores a hit go to step 3
    otherwise go to step 4.
3. Roll the damage dice (d6) and the location dice (d10) together and apply the damage modifier of the location
    rolled, the Weapons DMG modifier (if any) and any damage bonus provided by other equipped items to the
    damage dice, then deduct the monsters DEF from the modified damage dice. The remaining amount is the
    number of HP that is dealt to the monster or monsters if encountering more than one (such as packs).
4. Now roll for the monsters attack, roll 1d100 equal to or below the monsters Attack Value (AV) value. If the
    result scores a hit go to step 5 otherwise start a new combat round.
5. Roll the damage dice (d6) and the location dice (d10) together and apply the damage modifier of the location
    rolled to the damage dice, then apply the monsters DMG modifier and deduct the characters DEF value for any
    armour worn on the location that has been hit. The remaining amount is the number of HP that is dealt to the
    character, how ever the character can offset up to 2 damage to armour/weapons equipped to the location struck
    in the form of repair damage and shade in 1 pip on the repair track for each point of damage deflected to the
    armour. If the monster survived a new combat round begins.


## MONSTER REACTION

At the start of each combat round roll for the monsters reaction.

| D10 Roll | Monsters Reaction |
| --- | --- |
| 10 | Monster will Escape | 
| 9 | Monster damaged last Round it will Escape | 
| 8 | Monster has less than Half HP it will Escape 3 Monster will Attack as normal | 
| 7 | Monster will Attack as normal | 
| 6 | Monster will Attack as normal | 
| 5 | Monster will Attack as normal | 
| 4 | Monster will Attack as normal | 
| 3 | Monster will Attack as normal | 
| 2 | Monster has less than ½ its HP gains AV+ | 
| 1 | Monster has less than ½ its HP gains AV+ | 


## HIT LOCATION

|Location Roll|Location Hit|Damage Mod||Location Roll|Location Hit|Damage Mod|
|---|---|---|----|---|---|---|
|1|Head|+3||6|Main Weapon||
|2|Back |+2||7|Off Weapon ||
|3|Torso|+1||8|Waist Belt Check||
|4|Arms|||9|Legs|-1|
|5|Hands|||10|Feet|-1|

## OFFSET DAMAGE TO A SHIELD

When a shield is equipped a character can use it to off set a number of damage equal to its Shield
rating, For Example: A shield with a defence rating of S4 could be used to deflect up to 4 points of
damage from an attack striking any location. Each point shades just half a pip of the shields repair
track.

## DEFENCE BONUS

Some items provide a character with a Defence Bonus rather than providing DEF to a slot. The
character sheet defines a DEF rating as a Bonus by using a + symbol. All + symbols in the DEF
column are added together (only add the DEF ratings that have a + on the character sheet) for a
combined total which is recorded at the bottom of the characters Equipped Item section as the
characters Defence Bonus or DB. During combat when a monster rolls equal to or less than the
character DB on its damage dice, the damage rolled is reduced by the characters DB.

_Example: Denny has a Defence Bonus of 2 and a monster with a DMG value of +2 has just scored
a hit to her head (+3 damage), luckily for Denny she is wearing a Mail Coif with a DEF of 2. She
rolls the monsters Damage dice and scores a 2. She modifies the result with the monster DMG
value +2 and +3 because the strike hit her head for a total of 7 (2+2+3=7), however because the
monster rolled a natural 2 which is equal to and less than her Defence Bonus (2) she can instantly
deduct her damage bonus from the monsters damage score which brings the damage score down to
2 (7-2=5), lastly because she is wearing the Coif she can now deduct its DEF (2) from monsters
damage score (5-2=3) and she suffers 3 damage._


## MONSTER CHARACTERISTICS

Monster have their own set of Characteristics that are used
for combat and show the rewards that are offered should it
be killed as shown below.

**GIANT RATS [C]** AV:25 DEF:0 HP:3/2/2 DMG: -
[K:Table P] _(Disease, Pack)_

Each Monster has a Name, a type [C] for creature, [H] for
Humanoid, [UD] for Undead and [D] for demon, an Attack
Value (AV), a Defence rating (DEF), Health Points (HP)
sometimes listed in multiples signifying that the monster is
made up of individuals, and a damage modifier (DMG).

Some monsters have Abilities which are shown in italics,
they effect your encounter with them and must be
observed.

In the above example the Giant Rats gain a bonus to their
AV for each individual HP remaining beyond the first ( _pack_ ) and they will inflict disease when they
score a natural 1 on their damage dice ( _Disease_ ).

Once a monster has been defeated the player checks the section marked [K] for Killed and rolls on
the table for the reward, sometimes the dice roll is modified and sometimes a choice of tables is
offered, all results may be added to the character sheet.

## MONSTER ABILITIES

**ATTACKS –** The Monster will attack a number of times equal to its attack rating during a round of
combat, once all attacks have been made, roll a damage dice for each attack that hit for a combined
damage total.

**DARK MAGIC** – Spell Casters found in the dungeons have attuned themselves with Dark Magic.
Roll 1d10 at the start of each combat round to see which magic spell they will use for the round. **1-

number of disease pips shaded they suffer 1 HP of damage.

**ETHEREAL -** The monster has no substance, normal weapons will simply pass through them. All
attacks made against an ethereal monster must be with a legendary weapon or a form of spell

**FEAR –** The monster may strike fear in any character that comes face to face with it. At the start of
each combat round the character must make a fear test. **FEAR** – Test: Int -15 [S: Attack as Normal]

**FIRE** – The monster in addition to its normal attack has some sort of fire attack that may strike a
character, each time a natural 1 is rolled for its damage the character may be set alight by its fire
attack **AVOID FIRE** – Test: Dex -5 [S: No Effect] [F:-2HP] _(Dodge)_

**FLY -** A character fighting a flying monster suffers -10 STR when making an attack roll. If using a
ranged weapon (Dex) no effect.

FREEZE** – Test: Dex [S: No Effect] [F: -1HP, -2 DEF Next Combat Round] _(Dodge)._

**LARGE** – The Monster is exceptionally large and will often deals more damage when it hits a
character than smaller monsters, therefore all damage dice results of 1 and 2 are re-rolled.

**PACK** – At the start of each combat round each monster still alive beyond the first adds +5 to its
AV. _Example if an encounter has 4 monsters still alive, they get AV+15 when they attack._

**PHASE -** The monster can phase in and out of reality making it a hard target to strike. The
character suffers -10 to their Str and Dex while attacking a monster with the Phase ability.

**POISON -** When a monster scores a natural 1 on their damage dice they infect the character with
Poison and the player shades in one pip on the poison track of the character sheet. Each time the
time track is refreshed they character must roll a d10 and if they score equal to or less than the
number of poison pips shaded they suffer 1 HP of damage and remove one pip from the poison
track.

**RESURRECTION** – The monster once killed may resurrect and come back to life again. When a
monster has been killed and before it has been looted, roll 1d10, if a 1 is rolled it immediately
returns to life just as when it was first encountered (Full HP) and the character must once again do
battle.

**REGENERATE –** The monster has the ability to restore lost HP, each time they roll a natural 1 on

**WEB** – At the end of each combat round the monster is alive the character makes an Avoid Web
Test. **AVOID WEB** – Test: Dex +20 [S: Attack as Normal] [F: Forfeit next attack, No Escape]
_(Dodge)_

## UNARMED COMBAT

There is no unarmed combat, an Adventurer that has no weapon is forced to flee each encounter, the
monsters are too fierce and tough to be killed with bare hands.

## INSTEAD OF ATTACKING

Characters have other options instead of making an attack during step 2 of the combat round.

## CHANGE WEAPON

Whatever a character has equipped as his main weapon or off Weapon at the time of combat
determines the weapon he must use for the combat, however he may forfeit his attack for that round
to change his weapon, just make the alterations on the character sheet.

## CAST A SPELL

Instead of making an attack the character can instead cast a spell from their spell book (see the Spell
Caster Ability).

## USE A BELT ITEM

Instead of making an attack a character can may use an item from his belt slots. Elixirs, Potions and
Scrolls are the only items that can be equipped to a belt.

## ESCAPING

To escape a monster the character forfeits his attack for the round and makes an escape test -

**ESCAPE COMBAT** – Test: Dex -10 [S:Remove Monster] [F:-2 HP] _(Escape)_

When a monster attempts to escape the player can simply allow it to escape, they may still perform
an attack if they wish, however if the monster is not killed by this attack it is removed from play
and does not provide any XP or Treasure.

Alternatively the character may forfeit their attack to block the monsters escape and force it to
remain in the combat by making a block escape test -

**BLOCK ESCAPE** – Test: STR-10 [S:Start Combat at Step 3] [F:Remove Monster] _(Escape)_

Monsters that are removed from combat must be removed from the combat track as they no longer
offer the character a reward.


## CHOOSING QUESTS

After creating a fresh character the player selects the first
quest listed on the Quest Table (TABLE Q – QUESTS) as
their starting quest, after the first quest has been played, they
should choose the second quest listed and so on until all 5
quests entitled “Dungeon Training” have at least been
attempted and the character has gained some experience and
gear to start attempting some of the more challenging quests
and begin rolling a d100 for their next quest.

After the first 5 quests have been attempted the player rolls on TABLE Q – QUESTS for their
future quests, roll a number of times equal to the characters Reputation value, the more reputation a
character has the more his services are required and the more quests they have to choose from.

When you complete a quest tick its check box on the Quest table to keep track of which quests you
have won. If you happen to roll a quest that has been ticked, you may roll again.

Some quests have an encounter modifier, these quests force a player to modify their dice roll when
rolling on TABLE E – ENCOUNTERS. The player must use this modifier at any time during the
quests when rolling on Table E – ENCOUNTER.

Once a quest has been chosen write it on the reverse of your Character sheet under Current Quests
and add an attempt to the quest log, then take a blank dungeon sheet (grid paper with entrance
marked at the bottom), the quest is now ready to begin.

## COMPLETING AND FAILING QUESTS

Each Quests has an objective that determines how a character will win the game, once the objective
is met the current quest has been accomplished and the character receives the reward listed and adds
1 point to the completed section of their Quest log.

Sometime in a game its better to cut your losses and knowing when to quit is an important part of
the game and survival of your characters. Therefore at any time (except when in combat) the player
can end the game, they add 1 point to the failed section of their Quest Log and suffer the fail costs
associated with the current quest. If the cost cannot be met the character is not permitted to end the
game and must press on, even if it means they will perish as a result, (see below for how costs are
paid).

- When a fail cost asks – ½ gp, the player divides his characters current gold (not including any gold in
    items or investments) in half (rounding up) and that is the number of gold pieces (gp) the character loses.
- Costs that effect skills such as -5 Skill or -10 Skill must be deducted from any skill that has enough of a
    bonus to be removed. For instance -5 Skill would require the chosen skill to have at the least a +5 bonus.
    If -5 was removed from a skill that had a +10 bonus then the skill would be reduced down to a +5 bonus.
- The fail cost of -1 CHA, reduces a primary characteristic by the amount shown.
- Costs that reduce REP (Reputation) can only be failed if the character has more than 1 REP, as reputation
    can never be reduced to below 1.


## TIME TRACK

Time is important to track in the dungeon, as characters attempt to
solve certain tasks time ticks away and there is a chance a wandering
monster may surprise them or their lantern may need refuelling. The
time track covers a full 12 hours (½ a day). When the rules instructs a
player to add time to the track it will look something like this “+1”
in this case the player shades in one clock of the time track on their
adventure sheet. At various times the track will trigger an effect and
ask the player to spend a flask of oil , eat some food  or roll to see
if they encounter a wandering monster. When the last clock face is
shaded the player refreshes the track by removing all of the shading
and leaving it blank and removing any bonuses in the bonus section.

If a character can not spend the required flask, because their supply is empty they are thrown into
darkness and are solely relying of what little light the dungeon may be emitting itself, until they can
spend a flask of oil again all of their characterises are reduced by 20. As a reminder shade in the sun
 at the top of the character sheet.

When a character does not spend a food from their supply they lose 1 HP as they become fatigued
and weak.

Each time the wandering monster symbol () shows on the Time Track there is a chance that a
monster may appear, the player rolls 1d10 and if the result is equal to or below the number shown a
monster has appeared, roll on Table E to see what has turned up.

## BEFORE YOUR NEXT QUEST

Before a new quest the player must perform a number of tasks in preparation for the forthcoming
adventure. The Reputation (REP) plays a great part in the procedures and the higher it is the better
choices the character has.

**1) REFRESH TRACKS –** Remove all Keys and Levers from their tracks (Keys and Levers only
open doors in a specific dungeon and are not carried over to your next quest), Refresh the Time
track (you do not need to eat a food or use oil) and remove any Objectives. The character may seek
the services of a healer and remove each Poison pip for 40 gp's and each Disease Pip for 65 gp's and
restore lost HP's for 20 gp's each.

**2) REPAIR ITEMS** – You can repair each pip of damage an item has sustained by spending 1/5 of
the items total value rounded (remove pip). Example an item worth 120gp would cost each pip
24gp's, most items have the Rep. (Repair) Cost listed for your convenience.

**3) SELL ITEMS** – You can remove any items from the Equipped, Belt, Backpack and Potions
section of the character sheet and receive the sold items value in gp.

**4) BUY REQUIRED ITEMS** – Some items are essentials and need to be equipped for the next
adventure. You can buy a maximum of 20 + your Reputation of items from **Table R – REQUIRED**
buy paying the gp costs listed and adding them to the appropriate sections of your Character Sheet.


**5) SEARCH THE MARKETS** – Roll on tables with the  symbol a number of times equal to your
characters Reputation value and choose one item to buy. You can roll on any of the tables but the
maximum number of times you can roll is based on your REPUTATION value. _Example Elric's
Character has a REP of 3 and decides to roll on_ **_TABLE A - ARMOUR_** _twice and_ **_TABLE W -
WEAPONS_** _once._

**6) TRAINING –** You may seek training from a scholar or coach to improve skills or characteristics.
Your REPUTATION determines the quality of the trainer and therefore you may shade in a
maximum number of pips on the experience tracks equal to your REPUTATION value split
amongst either skills or characteristics. It costs 200 GP to shade each pip on a Skill experience track
and 2000 GP to shade in each pip on a Characteristic experience track. _Example: Elric's REP is 3
and decides to shade in one characteristic pip and 2 skill pips which costs him a total of 2400gp._

**7) MAGIC TUITION –** You must have your spell book unlocked to use this feature. You may roll
a number of times equal to your REPUTATION value to see which spells are available for you to
learn from the Wizards Council. You may choose only one of the spells rolled and it costs 800gp.

**8) EMPIRE BUILDING –** Building an empire can secures fame and fortune and with the right
planing you character may even build an empire that rivals that of royalty. Between quests
characters can invest their Gold in various investment programs, there are four areas of investment
(Finance, Holdings, Wars, and Trade Goods).

The character invests by purchasing shares in the four different types of investments, the amount of
gold each share is worth is shown on the Empire building section of the Character Sheet. When a
share is bought the character deducts the gold from his gold pieces and adds one share to the
selected investment.

After a quest has been played (regardless if it failed or succeeded) the character rolls on the
investment table cross references the result with the investment they have shares in.

_Example: Wilma has invested 3 shares in Finance and 2 shares in Holdings, she rolls the dice and
cross references the result firstly with Finance and then with Holdings._

The investment Table (J – INVESTMENTS) will either instruct an investment to loose one share or
pip, have no gain, or gain one share or pip. When a share is lost or gained simple remove or add one
share to the investment total, when a pip is lost or gained either remove on pip or shade one pip of
the investment. A pip is worth 1/5 of a share, so when the investment track is full, you can remove
all pips and add one share to the investments total. When pips are removed and you do not have
enough to meet the required amount (i.e. you need to remove 4 pips, but you only have 3 shaded on
the track), remove first as many pips as you can, then deduct one share and refill the track to 5 pips
and continue removing pips until you have met the requirement.

Investment rolls effect each share a character has invested, so if a character is instructed to lose 3
pips and they have 4 shares, they will lose 12 pips in that investment.

_Example: Wilma has 3 Shares in finance and 2 pips shaded. She needs to remove 4 pips, first she
erases the 2 pips from the track, leaving a balance of 2 pips that still need to be paid. She deducts 1
share (leaving 2 shares in finance) and shades in all 5 pips of the track. Lastly she erases the 2
outstanding pips._


After all investment rolls have been made the character is free to sell or buy shares for the values
shown, pips can never be bought, but they can be sold for 1/5 of a full share value. An adventurer
however may not hold more than 10 shares in any one investment.

## TURNS

Once a quest has been selected the player begins playing turns and follow a number of steps as
detailed below.

1. **ADJUST EQUIPMENT** – The player can equip or unequipped any number of items from their
    equipment slots to and from their backpack.
2. **TIME TRACK** - Shade +1 to the time track, if it triggers an effect you must deal with it first.
3. **EXITS** - choose an exit to move through and rotate the map so the exit is furthest from you. If a
    door blocks your way, it must be open in order to proceed. You may attempt to open doors as many
    times as you like, just follow the instructions for the door on TABLE D – DOORS. If you want to
    change to another exit , simply rotate the map so the new exit is furthest from you (you must observe
    any geographic features that may block this exit or require a test to use) and continue until a exit is
    either clear (no door) or the door is open (mark on map).
4. **AREA** – If the area has already been mapped you may use any of the features it holds, if a monster
    is present, you must encounter it. If the area hasn't been mapped roll on TABLE M – MAPPING for
    the area and add it to the map, the orientation of the area ha to be added to the map as it is shown on
    TABLE M – MAPPING you are not permitted to rotate a result. If there are any doors roll on
    TABLE D – Doors and mark the result next to each door. If the area is yellow, proceed. If the are is
    Red roll for an encounter, if it is green roll and follow the instructions on TABLE G –
    GEOGRAPHIC and if it is blue check your current quest to see if it has any significance.
5. **SEARCH** – You may now search the area and hunt for anything of interest by rolling on TABLE F –
    FIND to see what you might find. You may only search an area once during a quest, mark each area
    you have searched with an S in a circle to show that it has been searched. Whether you searched an
    area or not the turn is now over and a new one begins from step 1.

## NOTES ON MAPPING

When Mapping you should be recording as accurately as you can, add the features with reference
numbers for more detailed areas. The grid paper uses 3 x 3 square blocks for each area you roll on
Table M – Mapping.

Which coloured area rolled on the table may be important later on (like when searching) and should
be recorded on the map, use the top right corner and record the areas as (Y) for Yellow, (GR) for
Green, (B) for Blue and (R) for red.

The areas have been drawn so all exits will line up with each other, they meet directly in their
middle and are of the same dimensions. When an exit is drawn that does not line up with an area
already mapped (i.e. ends in rock) the exit is a dead end and does not go anywhere. It is
recommended that you shade dungeon rock with a hash shading ///// (see diagram).

When a door is shown on a section, add it to the map and roll for what kind of door it is. Add its


details if it is not open. Open doors should be marked “OPEN”, the other door types should be
marked with their type and then add their reference number (i.e. TLD (54) or MS (44).

If you escape a monster, mark the monster in that section, the next time you encounter it, it will be
back to full health.

Some geographic features span across an area from corner to corner blocking exits on opposite
sides. Draw on the features and mark them on the map with a reference number. Others have
something to interact with, like levers, when they have been interacted with Mark as close to the
bottom right of the area with an (I) on the map.

Sometimes the dungeon will block your progress, maybe the only available door is magically sealed
(MS) and you don't have an open scroll or spell, or perhaps all exits are blocked, in these rare
occurrences you are permitted to add a secret passage through any solid rock of any area you have
mapped to continue with the quest.

### COMBAT

At the start of each combat round roll for the monsters reaction.

```
D10 Roll Monsters Reaction D10 Roll Monsters Reaction
10 Monster will Escape 5 Monster will Attack as normal
9 Monster damaged last Round it will Escape 4 Monster will Attack as normal
8 Monster has less than Half HP it will Escape 3 Monster will Attack as normal
7 Monster will Attack as normal 2 Monster has less than ½ its HP gains AV+5
6 Monster will Attack as normal 1 Monster has less than ½ its HP gains AV+10
```
If an attack ensues the Character attacks first, followed by monster, all attacks happen simultaneously, If character kills monster it
still has attack roll for round.

1. Roll on the monster reaction chart and follow its instruction, then continue to step 2.
2. The character rolls a d100 to attack the monster and must score equal to or below his Str or Dex depending on the weapon
    being used – Hand Weapons (H) uses STR, Ranged Weapons (R) uses DEX to hit the monster. If the character has two
    weapons equipped either may be used, but not both. If the result scores a hit go to step 3 otherwise go to step 4.
3. Roll the damage dice (d6) and the location dice (d10) together and apply the damage modifier of the location rolled, the
    Weapons DMG modifier (if any) and any damage bonus provided by other equipped items to the damage dice, then deduct
    the monsters DEF from the modified damage dice. The remaining number is the HP that is dealt to the monster/s.
4. Now roll for the monsters attack, roll 1d100 equal to or below the monsters Attack Value (AV) value. If the result scores a
    hit go to step 5 otherwise start a new combat round.
5. Roll the damage dice (d6) and the location dice (d10) together and apply the damage modifier of the location rolled to the
    damage dice, then apply the monsters DMG modifier and deduct the characters DEF value for any armour worn on the
    location that has been hit. The remaining amount is the number of HP that is dealt to the character, how ever the character
    can offset up to 2 damage to armour equipped to the location struck in the form of repair damage and shade in 1 pip on the
    repair track for each point of damage deflected to the armour. If the monster survived a new combat round begins.
